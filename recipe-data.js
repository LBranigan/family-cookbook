The color of the shell has no effect on taste or nutrition — it's determined by the breed of the hen that laid the egg. Eggs should always be refrigerated but never frozen in the shell. Because egg shells are porous, they tend to absorb odors. Keep them separate from foods with strong aromas. Soiled eggs should be wiped with a clean, dry cloth before storing. Eggs can be refrigerated for a week or more, but flavor and quality are reduced with time.",
